# Learning C

 **Code Implementation from the book "The C Programming Language written by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie"**

 - 'size_t' is specifically intended for sizes and memory-related quantities, like array indexing and memory allocation.
 - 'unsigned int' is a general-purpose unsigned integer type and can be used wherever a non-negative integer is required, but it's not specifically intended for sizes or memory allocation.
 - 'register' storage class specifier is used to suggest that a variable should be stored in a CPU register for faster access. 
 - 'char **' is a pointer to a 'char *', meaning it points to a pointer that in turn points to a 'char'.
